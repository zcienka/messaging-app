## Messaging app
---
An app that allows real time communication using websockets on all devices.

The users can:
- search for a given user and start a conversation
- create an account
- delete an account
- log out

Authorization was made using JWT and authentication is custom. I used paging and
infinite scrolling design to load messages.

## Technologies

- React
- ASP .NET Core 6.0
